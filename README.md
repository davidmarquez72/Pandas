funtion dashboard()	

"Using the datetime library, I get the current date in the format ""yyyy-mm-dd"".
Using the os library, the dynamic path for the ""Pendientes4.xlsx"" and ""info.xlsx"" file is generated
Then, the Pandas library is used to read the files. Next, you create a new DataFrame that contains only the required columns. Then, another DataFrame is generated by specifically selecting the desired columns from the ""Pendientes4.xlsx"" file. This new dataset is saved in a file called ""info.xlsx"".
Finally, the function returns a value of 2 if executed successfully. Otherwise, it returns the error line along with an explanatory message of the error."
